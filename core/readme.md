# 🚀 TAGE Branch Predictor for CVA6

This document describes the **architecture and functional behavior of the TAGE branch predictor integrated into the CVA6 core**.  
The explanation focuses on the **prediction stage (fetch time)** and the **resolution stage (execute time)**.

The **TAGE (TAgged GEometric history length) predictor** improves branch prediction accuracy by using **multiple predictor tables with different global history lengths**.

Each table captures correlations at **different history depths**, allowing the predictor to learn both **short-term and long-term branch behavior**.

The architecture implemented in this project consists of:

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **BHT (Base Predictor)** | A simple PC-indexed predictor using a **2-bit saturating counter**, serving as the fallback prediction source when no tagged table provides a valid match. |
| **TAGE Tables (T1–T4)** | Multiple tagged predictor tables indexed using a combination of the **program counter (PC)** and **folded global history**, each table using a different history length. |
| **Global History Register (GHR)** | Records the outcomes of recent branches and is used to compute indices and tags for the TAGE tables. It is implemented as a **circular shift register**. |
| **Folded Index and Tag Registers** | Compressed representations of the global history used to generate **table indices and tags**. These folded histories are implemented using **circular shift registers**. |
| **Table Allocation & Useful Bit Controller** | Manages entry allocation in TAGE tables and updates the **useful bits (u-bits)** based on prediction correctness to control entry replacement. |
| **Prediction Selector** | Selects the final prediction using the **alternative prediction policy**, choosing between the provider table and an alternative prediction when the provider confidence is low. |

### 📦 Table Entry Structure

#### Table 0 (Base Predictor)
- **2-bit Saturating Counter**  
  Incremented when the branch is **taken** and decremented when the branch is **not taken**.
  
- **Valid Bit**  
  Indicates whether the entry contains a valid prediction.  
  If the entry is not valid, the predictor falls back to **static branch prediction**.

---

#### Table 1–3 (Tagged TAGE Tables)
- **2-bit Saturating Counter**  
  Incremented when the branch is **taken** and decremented when the branch is **not taken**.

- **Valid Bit**  
  Indicates whether the predictor entry is valid.  
  If the entry is not valid, the predictor falls back to **static branch prediction**.

- **Tag**  
  Stores the tag used to verify whether the table entry corresponds to the current branch PC.

- **Useful Bit (u-bit)**  
  Indicates whether the entry has been useful for correct predictions.  
  If the useful bit is **0**, the entry becomes a candidate for **replacement or new allocation**.

# 🔮 Prediction Stage (Fetch)

During instruction fetch, the predictor performs the following steps:

### 1️⃣ Parallel Table Lookup

For an incoming **PC**, the predictor computes:

- **Index**
- **Tag**

for each TAGE table using:
